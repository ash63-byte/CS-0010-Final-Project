# Abstraction
The best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on our data analysis is Mount Oliver. Although it is small in size, this neighborhood has the least incidents of 311 occurences, fires, and police interefernce. We decided safety as out metric because the datasets we found all had to do with the problems that show the amount of crime, muncipal issues and fires that took place in the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh.
